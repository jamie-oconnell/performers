      description: `After a very brief trek back to Australian shores earlier this year with previous single “Hear My Voice” and then playing a bunch of sold out homecoming shows across the country, Hein Cooper is back again from writing in British coastal towns and cinematic French chalets with follow up single “Over Again” – the second taste of new music from the prolific singer-songwriter.
  
      The result is fresh; the foundations of the Australian’s folk/indie pop styles are still present, with hundreds of thousands of kilometres or experiences under his belt, it’s now mixed with new genres and inspirations. 
      
      Releasing debut album ‘The Art Of Escape’ in 2016 with smash hit single “Rusty” and break out title track “The Art Of Escape”, Hein spent the better part of that year touring the country supporting James Bay and again co-headlining with Lanks, before returning briefly for Falls Festival at the end of the year.
      
      Excited to bring this new music back home to Australia, Hein is readying a collection of new material for upcoming headline shows nationally in January and February.
      
      Joining Hein on all shows will be Canada’s talented multi­-instrumentalist brothers, Mickaël and Raphaël Fortin known Hey Major who have also just unveiled the new video for their stunning new single, ‘Brother’.
